# Pay of mortgage, or invest?

## Introduction

This is a simple calculator to help you decide whether to pay off your mortgage or invest your money.

Basically the answer is the same as the answer to the question: "What is the expected return on my investment?" If the expected return on your investment is higher than the interest rate on your mortgage, then you should invest your money. Otherwise, you should pay off your mortgage.
